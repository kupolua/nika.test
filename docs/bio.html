    Veronika (Nika) Gandzha born in Ukraine, now lives in Jersey City, N.J. As a young child, Nika developed a passion for drawing illustrations with compelling storytelling. She went on to study International Relationships and received B.A. and M.A. in Humanities from the Slavistic University.

    Once in the U.S., Nika’s creativity led her to explore coursework at New York Botanical Gardens as she developed her artistry of floral illustrations. She began to derive her inspiration from flowers and children – her love of color theory, line work, and small objects became prominent in her portfolio of work. Nika experienced a shift in her artwork when she became a wife and mother. She now specializes in children’s book illustrations; her narrative centers around awareness of having a choice when faced with everyday challenges. Her work creatively weaves in life concepts through a masterpiece of illustrations that are easily understood by children.

    Nika has combined her artistry and creative passion into launching a book series; the first book is titled “Fly” – a heartfelt journey of a fly that is thrown into a life challenging situation only to be remedied by a simple choice. Her illustrations are integrated into three-dimensional books meant to engage children as they explore each lesson. Combining skill and passion in the form of her illustrations has moved Nika to convey encouragement as she impacts the world one child at a time.
